<p>“This story was a fast paced, entertaining, and cute read. The romcom aspect of the book was cute and fluffy. It was magical, sweet, and funny not to mention it has some of my favorite tropes. Found family is one of my favorite tropes and I absolutely adored the side characters: Mr. Yoon, Adel, Frida. They brought humor to the story and their characters were very loveable. I feel like the concept of this book was unique and done very well. This is my first book by this author but I can't wait to see whaat she has in store for readers in the future.”</p>
