                In an effort to save the Christmas tree farm she’s loved since
                she was a kid, Stella enters a contest with Instagram-famous
                influencer Evelyn St. James. With the added publicity and the
                $100,000 cash prize, Stella might just be able to save the farm
                from its financial woes. There’s just one problem. To make the
                farm seem like a romantic destination for the holidays, she lied
                on her application and said she owns Lovelight Farms with her
                boyfriend. Only…there is no boyfriend. Enter best friend Luka
                Peters. He just stopped by for some hot chocolate and somehow
                got a farm and a serious girlfriend in the process. But fake
                dating his best friend might be the best Christmas present he’s
                ever received.

                Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her
                sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now
                Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett
                thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year
                performance where the audience participates in the show—are
                over. But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation
                finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella
                whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive,
                Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It
                turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and
                whoever finds her first is the winner. As Scarlett becomes
                enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic, she must find
                Tella before a dangerous domino effect of consequences will be
                set off, and her beloved sister will disappear forever.

                Daphne always loved the way her fiancé, Peter, told their
                story... right up until the moment he realized he was actually
                in love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how
                Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay,
                Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a
                children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing
                to be roommates with the only person who could possibly
                understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak, the exact
                opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne. The roommates mainly
                avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows,
                they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also
                involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer
                adventures together, well, who could blame them? But it’s all
                just for show, of course, because there’s no way Daphne would
                actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her
                ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex... right?

                Orphaned as a baby, nineteen-year-old Signa has been raised by a
                string of guardians, each one more interested in her wealth than
                her well-being—and each has met an untimely end. Her remaining
                relatives are the elusive Hawthornes, an eccentric family living
                at Thorn Grove, an estate both glittering and gloomy. Its
                patriarch mourns his late wife through wild parties, while his
                son grapples for control of the family’s waning reputation, and
                his daughter suffers from a mysterious illness. But when their
                mother’s restless spirit appears claiming she was poisoned,
                Signa realizes that the family she depends on could be in grave
                danger and enlists the help of a surly stable boy to hunt down
                the killer. However, Signa’s best chance of uncovering the
                murderer is an alliance with Death himself, a fascinating,
                dangerous shadow who has never been far from her side. Though
                he’s made her life a living hell, Death shows Signa that their
                growing connection may be more powerful—and more
                irresistible—than she ever dared imagine.

                An ultimatum from Summer Preston’s thesis advisor thrusts her
                into an unexpected collision with the hockey team’s captain,
                Aiden Crawford. She’s caught between conflicting desires of
                fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a sport psychologist
                and staying as far away as possible from the god-awful sport.
                And once she meets Aiden—well, let’s just say he confirms all
                her worst assumptions about hockey players. Being the captain of
                the college hockey team has its perks, except when a reckless
                mistake by Aiden’s team threatens to jeopardize their entire
                season. As punishment, Aiden’s coach nominates him as the
                subject of a student research project. Participating is the last
                thing he wants to do, especially since the girl leading the
                project looks like she could wield his skates as a weapon.
                Summer can’t stand Aiden’s blasé approach to life, and Aiden
                doesn’t understand why she’s twenty years old with a
                twenty-five-year plan. But their bickering soon turns to
                bantering—and once they let their guards down, there’s nothing
                to check their feelings.

                In a land without magic, assassin Celaena Sardothien is summoned
                to the castle. She has no love for the vicious king who rules
                from his throne of glass, but she has not come to kill him. She
                has come to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three
                murderers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she will be
                released from prison to serve as the King’s Champion. The Crown
                Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect
                her. And a princess from a faraway country will befriend her.
                But something rotten dwells in the castle, and it’s there to
                kill. When her competitors start dying mysteriously, one by one,
                Celaena’s fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival-and a
                desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her
                world.

              <p class="card-text">
                Cambridge professor Emily Wilde is good at many things: She is
                the foremost expert on the study of faeries. She is a genius
                scholar and a meticulous researcher who is writing the
                world&#39;s first encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde
                is not good at people. She could never make small talk at a
                party--or even get invited to one. And she prefers the company
                of her books, her dog, and the Fair Folk. So when she arrives in
                the hardscrabble village of Hrafnsvik, Emily has no intention of
                befriending the gruff townsfolk. Nor does she care to spend time
                with another new arrival: her dashing and insufferably handsome
                academic rival Wendell Bambleby, who manages to charm the
                townsfolk, get in the middle of Emily&#39;s research, and
                utterly confound and frustrate her. But as Emily gets closer and
                closer to uncovering the secrets of the Hidden Ones--the most
                elusive of all faeries--lurking in the shadowy forest outside
                the town, she also finds herself on the trail of another
                mystery: Who is Wendell Bambleby, and what does he really want?
                To find the answer, she&#39;ll have to unlock the greatest
                mystery of all--her own heart.

                Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the
                Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history.
                Now, her commanding general motherordered Violet to join the
                hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre:
                dragon riders. But when you’re smaller than everyone else and
                your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away because
                dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.
                With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill
                Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would
                kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden
                Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders
                Quadrant. She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to
                see the next sunrise. Yet, with every day that passes, the war
                outside grows more deadly, the kingdom&#39;s protective wards
                are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse,
                Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.
                Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has
                an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out:

                On the night Rune’s life changed forever, blood ran in the
                streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution,
                witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts
                ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide
                what she is. Spending her days pretending to be nothing more
                than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the
                Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being
                purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch
                hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs
                by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe – a notorious and
                unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution – who she
                can&#39;t help but find herself falling for. Gideon loathes the
                decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns
                the Crimson Moth has been using Rune’s merchant ships to smuggle
                renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into
                her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He
                soon realizes that beneath her beauty and shallow façade, is
                someone fiercely intelligent and tender who feels like his
                perfect match. Except, what if she’s the very villain he’s been
                hunting?
